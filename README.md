# 🤖 3D Robotic Arm with 5 Degrees of Freedom

This project is a 3D model of a robotic arm with **5 degrees of freedom (5 DOF)**, designed using **Autodesk Inventor**. The design simulates the motion of a human-like arm, consisting of multiple joints and segments, and is ideal for applications such as education, simulation, research, or 3D printing platforms.

---

## 📝 Project Description

The robotic arm was created to demonstrate mechanical movement and modular joint control using CAD tools. Each part of the arm was modeled separately and then assembled to provide full rotational and bending freedom across five axes.

---

## 🎯 Purpose of the Project

- To understand the mechanical design of a multi-joint robotic arm  
- Practice using Autodesk Inventor in 3D modeling and assemblies  
- Build a foundational model that can later be animated or motorized  

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Software Used

- **Autodesk Inventor** – for 3D modeling and assembly  
- **Windows OS** – development platform  
- **GitHub** – for version control and sharing

## 🧩 Arm Structure

1. Rotating Base  
2. First (vertical) joint  
3. Second (horizontal) joint  
4. Third joint (forearm section)  
5. End-effector section (tool mount or gripper)

---

## 🚀 How to Run the Project

1. Open **Autodesk Inventor**  
2. Click `File > Open` and load the main assembly file (`.iam`)  
3. Use the rotation and pan tools to view the arm from different angles  
4. Optionally, export parts to `.STL` for 3D printing or simulation  

---

## 🛠️ How to Modify

- To edit individual parts, open the corresponding `.ipt` files  
- To add new segments or actuators, insert them via `Design > Place Component`  
- Adjust joint motion via `Joint Constraints` or dynamic simulation tools
